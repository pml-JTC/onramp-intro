      <h2>A Navy Brat raised on the East Coast</h2>
      <p>The first things I can remember are crystal blue waters and coral reefs</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Born in Portsmouth, VA at the Naval Hospital that's been functioning since 1830,<br>
            my father was stationed in Key West when my brain started retaining memories</li>
        <li>I learned to swim at 2, holding my mother's neck as she swam to the bottom of the deep end<li>
        <li>At Montessori school I pressed shells into plaster of paris, and grew an avocado<li>
        <li>We moved back to Virginia--Virginia Beach to be exact--the year I started kindergarten</li>

<!--Losing  My Mother and the Aftermath Section-->
  <section>
    <div>
      <h2>Mary was my guiding light, and when she died I was lost</h2>
      <p>As strong as I know my Mother was, her life was too much for her to bear</p>
      <ul>
        <li>She was a teacher and a natural leader, everyone could depend on her</li>
        <li>But she really had no one to depend on except her social worker and psychiatrist<br>
            and became overwhelmed and overmedicated--after ECT she was no longer herself</li>
        <li>When she died, my family was already broken, but now my North Star had burned out</li>
      </ul>

<!--College and TBI Section-->
  <section>
    <div>
      <h2>Dreams of being a doctor dashed on the ground</h2>
      <p>Pride always come before a fall</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The chaos of my adolescence--losing my Mother, moving from school to school--made it hard to get into my top choice schools</li>
        <li>At Syracuse University I got off to a very strong start, so strong that I decided to transfer to NYU for stronger academics</li>
        <li>During the last month of my Freshman year I had a skateboarding accident that resulted in a long-term cognitive difficulty</li>
        <li>At NYU I felt unable to perform, and didn't want to face that I might struggle with focusing forever<br>
            so I daydreamed as my pre-med dreams faded away</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
  </section>

  <!--Advertising and Alcohol Section-->
  <section>
    <div>
      <h2>Writing copy for the companies that killed her?</h2>
      <p>I got my start in medical communications interning as a Copy Department Assistant at a boutique Medical Education firm</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A girlfriend who was also on all loans at NYU was working as an Editorial Assistant and got me a job as a Copy Assistant</li>
        <li>Working on staff for a year there after graduating college I was approached by a project manager who told me about Pharma Advertising</li>
        <li>While a lucrative and intellectually stimulating career, working as a pharmaceutical copywriter felt like I was working for the same industry that filled my mother's hand with pills,<br>
            an industry driven by profit so not incentivized to determine root causes of mental illness</li>
        <li>Just 24 and already making a good living, <em>but not the one I wanted</em>, I sabotaged my success with heavy drinking and drugs</li>
      </ul>

  <!--Oblivion to Prison Section-->
  <section>
    <div>
      <h2>Self-medication ends in self-destruction</h2>
      <p>What goes up, must come down</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My cognitive difficulty seemed to "improve" when I used stimulants, so I began using them all the time</li>
        <li>I lived a rock star lifestyle and began a cycle of getting hired and fired almost yearly</li>
        <li>The idea was to work in advertising for a while and go back school, but I ended up homeless</li>
        <li>On the street I turned to petty crime to stay high, and crime led to prison</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!--Recovery and Redemption Section-->
  <section>
    <div>
      <h2>Answering the call</h2>
      <p>Changing perspectives and drawing strength from "weakness"</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I read a great book in prison that helped me realize that I didn't just have focusing issues, I was severely traumatized</li>
        <li>Now I am working through my traumas, avoiding drugs and alcohol, and finding my way back to academia</li>
        <li>In the years since I graduated with a BS in Neural Science, <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/center-for-computational-psychiatry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computational Psychiatry</a><br>
            has emerged as a truly rigorous approach to deliniating the underlying functional causes of severe mental illnesses</li>
        <li>The value of lived experience has also become central to efforts to fight stigma and develop effective treatments,<br>
            including non-pharmacological approaches like <a href="//www.motifneuro.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brain-Computer Interface</a> and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>My hope is to share my lived experience and contribute to the reduction of stigma by applying the coding skills I learn to fields improving mental healthcare</h3>
