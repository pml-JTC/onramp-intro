      <div>
        <h2>Mental health awareness is higher than ever, yet mental healthcare stands to improve in many ways</h2>
        <p>Since losing my mother to suicide I have wanted to contribute to the improvement of mental healthcare. A lot is the same as it was 30 years ago:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mental illnesses remain poorly understood</li>
          <li>Pill burden is still often high for people managing severe conditions</li>
          <li>Stigma, while decreasing, is still a main barrier that prevents people from seeking help</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <!--Key Interests Section-->
    <section>
      <div>
        <h2>Many areas of research are interesting to me, but my overall goal is to protect lives through increasing knowledge</h2>
        <p>A lot of the issues with mental healthcare stem from lacking an understanding of disease etiology. I am most interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How valuation and decision-making are coupled with stress management</li>
          <li>How social determinants of health influence the incidence rates and outcomes of mental health challenges</li>
          <li>How non-pharmacological interventions, including brain-computer interface technology might make treatment more precise</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <!--Potential Careers Section-->
    <section>
      <div>
        <h2>Several career options align with these unmet needs and my interests</h2>
        <p>Coding is needed in all of the following, but might be applied in different ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Computational Psychiatry Research: experimental design, data acquisition and analysis, modeling</li>
          <li>Public Mental Health: predictive analytics, machine learning, data analysis for policy reform</li>
          <li>Neurotechnology: processing vast amounts of data, creating simulations, building device application software</li>      
        </ul>
      </div>
