        <h2>Mental health awareness is higher than ever, yet mental healthcare stands to improve in many ways</h2>
        <p>Since losing my mother to suicide I have wanted to contribute to the improvement of mental healthcare. A lot is the same as it was 30 years ago:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.caldwellmemorial.org/blog/causes-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mental illnesses remain poorly understood</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3653237/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pill burden is still often high for people managing severe conditions</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/stigma-and-discrimination" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stigma, while decreasing, is still a main barrier that prevents people from seeking help</a></li>

    <section>
      <div>
        <h2>Many areas of research are interesting to me, but my overall goal is to protect lives through increasing knowledge</h2>
        <p>A lot of the issues with mental healthcare stem from lacking an understanding of disease etiology. I am most interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352154616301905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How valuation and decision-making are coupled with stress management</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How social determinants of health influence the incidence rates and outcomes of mental health challenges</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How non-pharmacological interventions, including brain-computer interface technology might make treatment more precise</a></li>
        </ul>

      <div>
        <h2>Several career options align with these unmet needs and my interests</h2>
        <p>Coding is needed in all of the following, but might be applied in different ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/research/research-centers/center-for-human-neuroscience/computational-psychiatry-unit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computational Psychiatry Research: experimental design, data acquisition and analysis, modeling</a></li>
